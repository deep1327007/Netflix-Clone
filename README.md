Hey there!

I'm excited to present my GitHub project—a Netflix website clone of the homepage. This was a hands-on project that I built while following the guidance provided by the Bharat Intern YouTube channel.

Throughout this endeavor, I delved into the intricate workings of large-scale websites, gaining insights into how they operate behind the scenes. Learning to fetch data from a database via API keys was a significant highlight among the many new things I discovered.

Working on projects like this has been an incredibly enjoyable experience. Even though similar projects might already exist and it's natural to feel like you're merely replicating someone else's code, the journey is where the real learning happens. Trust me, there were challenges along the way—figuring out how all the pieces fit together to make a website function is no small feat.

During this journey, I sought guidance from resources like W3 Schools and ChatGPT. Remember, there's no shame in seeking help when you're stuck. Embrace being a beginner from time to time—it's an integral part of growth.

Stay persistent, tackle those bugs, refine your code (even if it feels a bit dumb at times), and yes, if needed, a keyboard might take a hit or two (we've all been there!). Build projects at your own pace, and with each endeavor, you'll undoubtedly become a more adept developer.

Keep hustling and coding away!
